# Autonomous Logistics

Welcome to the open source repo for [our web site](https://www.autonomouslogistics.co). We strongly believe in the value of open source and sharing knowledge that has common value. Feel free to dig around in our code and see how we've modified a free template from Start Bootstrap.

Site version: v2.0.0

## Building the Site

To rebuild the site from scratch and serve up live changes in dev mode, we use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/):

```bash
gulp dev
```

To run maintenance tasks, use `npm`:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

## Attributions

With the exception of a few dollars per month in AWS charges and our personal time, our web site was built for free. Why wouldn't we pay someone? Our web site is partly to demonstrate the power of the analytical individual and the strength of the open source community.
